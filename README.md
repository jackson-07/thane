Version one of a VS code extension built for productivity in TypeScript. I am using webpack as a build tool so to run:

```
npm run compile
```

Then:

```
npm run watch
```

Followed Press F5 or Run > 'Start Debugging' to open the Extension Development Host

In the new window, try Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac) and type any of these commands (likely to rename them):

- Add Action
- Show Actions
- Complete Action
- Start Timer
- Stop Timer
- Convert Action to Issue
- Add Issue

Hoping to add improvements and UI before publishing.
